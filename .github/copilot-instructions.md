TODO: After completing your security audit, add rules here
that would help Copilot avoid suggesting the vulnerabilities you found.

Example rules you might add:
- Use textContent instead of innerHTML
- Never use eval() or new Function()
- Check npm audit before adding dependencies

This file teaches your AI assistant to follow security best practices.
